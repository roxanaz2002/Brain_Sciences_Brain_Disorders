# final review
## MRI
### fMRI & sMRI
### T1,T2
These times are related to the behavior of hydrogen nuclei (protons) in a magnetic field.
- visualizing anatomy and pathology
- T1-weighted image: fat appears bright and fluid appears dark.
- T2-weighted image: visualizing fluid-filled structures and pathology. Fluid appears bright and fat appears dark.
### Tissue differentiation - Fat v water
- Protons in the body realign and dephase with varying rapidity depending on the tissue type
- Detecting the signal after different time intervals allows different tissue types to be highlighted
- Protons in fat realign quickly with high energy and produce high T1 signal, producing 'T1-weighted' images (highlight fat) 
- Protons in water dephase slowly, exploited to produce 'T2-weighted' images (highlight water)
