# final review
## MRI
### CT v MRI - brain
- CT is a map of tissue density – white areas represent higher density tissues than blacker areas
- MRI is a map of proton energy in tissues of the body – white areas represent high ‘signal’
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is low density on CT
- On T2 MRI image the CSF is white – indicating high signal
- White areas on an X-ray or CT image = high density
- White areas on an MRI image = high signal
### fMRI & sMRI


### Tissue differentiation - Fat v water
- Protons in the body realign and dephase with varying rapidity depending on the tissue type
- Detecting the signal after different time intervals allows different tissue types to be highlighted
- Protons in fat realign quickly with high energy and produce high T1 signal, producing 'T1-weighted' images (highlight fat) 
- Protons in water dephase slowly, exploited to produce 'T2-weighted' images (highlight water)
## MRI interpretation
### Contrast agents(对比剂)
- Gadolinium: the most common MRI contrast agent (can be given intravenously or injected directly into a body part)
- Abnormal tissue may enhance more than surrounding normal tissue following intravenous gadolinium; may also retain gadolinium longer than normal tissue
### Planes
- axial 轴位 
- coronal 冠状位
- sagittal 矢状位
- oblique 斜位
### Sequences: T1,T2,T2 Flair
These times are related to the behavior of hydrogen nuclei (protons) in a magnetic field, visualizing anatomy and pathology
- T1: weighted image: fat appears bright and fluid appears dark.
- T2: weighted image: visualizing fluid-filled structures and pathology. Fluid appears bright and fat appears dark.
Look at the fat-sensitive T1 images which often provide good anatomical detail of the area being studied
Compare with the water-sensitive images – such as the T2-weighted or STIR images
 - **Remember**
    - On T1 – 1 tissue type is bright – FAT
    - On T2 – 2 tissue types are bright – FAT and WATER
